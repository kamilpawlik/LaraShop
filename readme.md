# Larashop - ecommerce platform built with Laravel
The idea of the project is to create only basic multi-lingual ecommerce engine (categories, products, prices, cart and users) with plugins and themes support.
Everything that is not a ecommerce basic functionality should be handled by plugins (displaying logo, listing featured products even site navigation..)
Engine should provide RESTFull API covered in 100% with it's functionality.

Think of it as basic engine which can be accessible via API, others of functionalities should be handled by plugins.
